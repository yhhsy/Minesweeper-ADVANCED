# Minesweeper-ADVANCED
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle computer game. 
# Objective
The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them. 
# Rules
Clicking with the left mouse button on the game board will reveal what is hidden underneath the chosen square or squares (a large number of blank squares [bordering 0 mines] may be revealed in one go if they are adjacent to each other). 
Some squares are blank while others contain numbers (from 1 to 8), with each number being the number of mines adjacent to the uncovered square.
The location of a suspected mine can be marked by flagging it with the right mouse button. 
The game is won once all blank or numbered squares have been uncovered by the player without hitting a mine, and all remaining mines identified by flags. 
However, in the event that the player had mistakenly flagged a safe square or hit a mine, that square will appear with a red bolder and shimming for seconds. 
# Custom Option
The game board comes in free square set sizes and bomb quantities with user defined by key-in numbers.
